# cf\_domain

Provides a resource for managing shared or private 
[domains](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/routes-domains.html#domains) in Cloud Foundry.

## Example Usage

The following is an example of a shared domain for a sub-domain of the default application domain 
retrieved via a [domain data source](http://localhost:4567/docs/providers/cloudfoundry/d/domain.html).

```
resource "cf_domain" "shared" {
    sub_domain = "dev"
    domain = "${data.cf_domain.apps.domain}"
}
```

The following example creates a private domain owned by the Org referenced by `cf_org.pcfdev-org.id`.

```
resource "cf_domain" "private" {
    name = "pcfdev-org.io"
    org = "${cf_org.pcfdev-org.id}"
}
```
