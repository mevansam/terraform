# bosh\_vm\_type

Provides a Bosh [VM Type](http://bosh.io/docs/cloud-config.html#vm-types) resource.

## Example Usage

The following declares a large VM Type for AWS and OpenStack.

```
# Configure the Bosh Large VM Type

resource "bosh_vm_type" "large" {
    
    name = "large"
    
    aws {
        instance_type = "m4.large"
    }
    openstack {
        instance_type = "m2.large"
    }
}
```
